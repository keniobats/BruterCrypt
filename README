BruterCrypt by Luciano Laporta Podazza
The main brute force algorithm was stolen from here:
http://www.rbgrn.net/content/25-how-to-write-brute-force-password-cracker

The rest of the code is just an adaptation :)

Running BruterCrypt
	python BruterCrypt.py MaxLength

	Where MaxLength is the maximum size of the password to test. Please note that you need TrueCrypt installed on your system in order to work

TODO
	Get volume sizes so that way you know if you cracked an outer volume or a hidden one.
	Improve performance, instead of calling the process over and over again, handle it on the fly like this:
